# 64 channel servo node based on a Nano this code has been created with the help of MERG Members

Code supplied by Phillip Edwards and permission to add it here was given by him to help others to learn how it can be done

It is for demonstration purposes only. 

This is what I use with a Nano and PCA9685 modules.

One Nano only and 4 of PCA9685's piggy backed.

Each servo can be set for distance and speed.

The only drawback is on startup all servos will cycle to determine their position.

This is setup in CMRI as an smini so only 48 inputs. I have not tried it but if node is set to SUSIC 992 servos from one Nano.
